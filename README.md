## About

NOTICE: THIS IS A TESTING FORK, AND NOT FOR GENERAL USE. DO NOT COMPLAIN TO MrPrimate OR MYSELF IF YOU HAVE ISSUES.

This is inspired by the previous [pathbuilder2e-import](https://github.com/kobseryqum/foundry-pathbuilder2e-import) package, but is written afresh from the ground up, capturing some of my experience from [DDB Importer](https://github.com/MrPrimate/ddb-importer).

To use this module the users must have the CREATE ACTOR ability, as it creates temporary actors as part of the import process.

## Known Issues

- There are differences between Pathbuilder names and Foundry names. If you find any, please open an issue, or drop a note in Discord with as much detail as possible, ideally with a shared link to a pathbuilder character.
- Support for "dual classed" characters from the Advanced Players guide is ropey at best, and not supported in Remastered system.

## Bugs and Issues

Please open bugs and issues on [github](https://github.com/MrPrimate/pathmuncher/issues/new/choose), or via the Discord channel [#pathmuncher](https://discord.gg/M6jvpfreNd).
